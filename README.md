# DeadInternetTheory

## üß† Concept

This project is inspired by the [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), a conspiracy theory suggesting that most of the internet is now generated and controlled by bots.

While there are many types of bots, this project focuses on **Group III**, the disruptive ones. Think spammy repost bots flooding social media platforms with generated content.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**  
> This repository is not a research paper on DIT.  
> If you're curious about the theory itself, go do your own homework.  
> This is about building the bot, not debating its origins.

### üß© Project Thinking

Originally, I just wanted to mess around with building a repost bot for TikTok.  
**Problem?** Simply downloading and re-uploading videos doesn‚Äôt work, they get flagged or struck almost immediately.

So I tried another approach: **generate idle games with Pygame** and post screen recordings. Technically it worked‚Ä¶ but honestly? It was tedious, low-impact, and time-consuming.

**Now:**  
I'm generating short videos using AI, then posting them. It‚Äôs fast, fun, and doesn‚Äôt trigger content violations. This seems like the most promising path, we‚Äôll see where it leads.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Thanks to Python‚Äôs simplicity (and chaos), you can run this project in just a few steps:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dolvui/DeadInternetTheory.git
cd DeadInternetTheory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Parameters

### `--sessions-path`

Load all necessary data, paths, sites, and JSON files for the script

```bash
python main.py --sessions-path="path/to/file.json"
```

**Expected JSON format:**

```json
{
  "main" : "<path of the main session .dat>",
  "pix_account" : ["<List of path to others accounts .dat>",...], 
  "chrome_path" : "path\\to\\chrome.exe",
  "links" : {
    "HOME_STUDIO" : "<home of the website>",
    "STUDIO" : "<creation page of the website>"
  },
  "database" : "path\\to\\database.db"
}
```
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is the only required parameter.  
> Without it, nothing works, so make sure to specify it on every launch.

---

### `--load-json`

Load a list of prompts/videos into the internal database.

```bash
python main.py --load-json="path/to/file.json"
```

**Expected JSON format:**

```json
[
  {
    "prompt": "<prompt for the IA>",
    "voix": "<spoken text for the IA to be added>",
    "description": "<description for social network>"
  },
  ...
]
```

---

### `--pix-credit`

Collect daily free image generation credits from a third-party service.

```bash
python main.py --pix-credit=True
```

---

### `--create`

Generate a video using an account and save it in the given path for future posting.

```bash
python main.py --create="path\\to\\videos\\directory"
```

---

### `--post`

Post a previously generated video on social media.

```bash
python main.py --post=True
```

---

### `--register`

Open a browser window to manually log in and save a session cookie.

```bash
python main.py --register="session_cookie.dat"
```

You‚Äôll have 2 minutes to log into your account. After that, the session cookie is saved to the file you specify.

> üéØ **Why this matters**  
> Modern sites make automated login a nightmare. But once you're logged in manually, we can re-use the saved session for future actions, one cookie file per account.

## üí° Usage Advise

To automate, so no human action is needed :

### üêß Linux

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello world !" 
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Windows

Here the base action needed, adapt to your case

Retrieve credit is the example chosen

#### Step 1

Prepare your Environment, open a Powershell in `C:\...\...\DeadInternetTheory\`

```Powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 2

Create a file `auto.bat` in `C:\...\...\DeadInternetTheory\`

so
`C:\...\...\DeadInternetTheory\auto.bat`

```bat
@echo off
cd /d C:\...\...\DeadInternetTheory\
call venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python main.py --sessions-path="sessions.json" --load-json="./idea.json"
```

#### Step 3

- Press `Win` + `S`, search Task Scheduler.
- Click Create Basic Task.
- Name: Run Script at 9AM.
- Trigger: Daily, time: 09:00.

## üêû Bugs  ü§®

> [!WARNING]  
> When creating a video, the page switches to fullscreen.  
> **However**, if you're on a laptop with a small screen, some elements might not be visible, which can cause the script to fail (`element is of type None`).  
> On a larger screen, everything works fine.  
>  
> I could patch this by calling `scroll_into_view()` on each element...  
> But honestly? *Too lazy for now.*
